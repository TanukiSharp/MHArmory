Text-based weapon set bonus selection

<body style='font-family:"Segoe UI"'>
Some weapons count as a piece to an armor set bonus. In the armor set bonus selection windows you can select this set bonus. It is possible to use the search bar to quickly toggle the armor set bonus selection.<br/>
When text is typed in the search bar, only matching results remain. For example if <b>attack</b> is typed, all armor set bonuses containing <b>attack</b> in their name, their description or the description of the abilities it grants, will remain in view.<br/><br/>
